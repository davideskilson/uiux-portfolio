        <h1>Iterative Design</h1>
        <h2>Introduction and Context</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, I worked with a team of three others and had the
          opportunity to work with the startup Uno Health that focuses on making
          it easier for the elderly and others to get government benefits they
          are entitled to. We worked on redesigning their document upload
          experience for a household application (e.g., an individual and their
          spouse), and in the process made improvements to the homepage and
          eligibility check. This project showcases my ability do design in a
          problem solving focused manner as well as my ability to work
          effectively in a team.

        <h2>Understanding the Brief and Sketching</h2>
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>
          As Uno Health's website currently stands, if users were to complete
          the application process for them and their spouse, there currently
          exists many duplicate upload sites for the separate persons. This
          makes the interface slightly overwhelming, so we were tasked to come
          up with a design that would alleviate this issue. We aimed to make
          both the home page and the upload process easier to navigate. More
          details can be found in our

        <h2>First Iteration Wireframing</h2>
        <h3>Low-fi Wireframe: Iteration 1</h3>

          href="https://www.figma.com/file/dTd1HvNalOHYYo3x9HFsvd/Iterative-Lo-Fi%2C-Style-Guide%2C-and-Hi-Fi?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=5aVrYg2mPhqQFJhq-1"
          >Here is the link to our Lo-Fi figma for a closer look.</a
        >
        <p>
          After brainstorming designs separately based on the brief, we then met
          up to discuss the merits of each of our designs. At the end, we took
          the format of the document upload box from Allison's design, the
          progress bar from David's design, the profile box from Pauline's
          design, and the document upload notification feature from Sophie's
          design. We also liked David and Pauline's idea of a linear flow of
          document uploads rather than a long list, so we incorporated that as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          We took several aspects into consideration during our creation of the
          final design. First of all, we wanted to break up the document
          uploading process into multiple pages to avoid the overwhelming
          feeling of many documents on one page. We also liked the idea of
          grouping the documents by creating subprofiles for the primary user
          and the spouse to avoid confusion. We also included labels at the top
          of the page to indicate the current user that we were navigating
          through. For ease of navigation, we also allowed the user to upload
          documents in a non-linear flow by providing a dropdown for navigating
          to specific documents and also allowing users to skip documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, we were paying closest attention to the ease of navigation
          and hiding the complexity of the original interface, and we believe
          that the creation of the linear flow behind a home page and a dropdown
          on the home page would do that for us.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Critique</h2>
        <p>
          Shortly after we created the first iteration wireframe, we made a
          <a
            class="bold"
            href="https://www.loom.com/share/14e64855d086451695c6f9b278d511b5?sid=fd8dc4d1-e8c2-4940-876c-011031ee8970"
          >

          </a>
          and then had a feedback session from other peers in the class. We also
          received feedback from Elise, our point of contact. Based on their
          feedback, it seems that we were able to accomplish our primary goals
          of eliminating complexity and providing ease of navigation, as they
          all praised the simplicity of our interface.
        </p>
        <h3>Peer Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          The largest piece of feedback that we received from our peers was
          regarding some slight confusion in differentiating interactive
          elements, specifically the fact that the "I live on my own" button was
          a completely different color. Another piece of feedback that they gave
          was that the interface was unclear in conveying behavior in
          unconventional settings. For example, what if a user hit "save and
          exit" when no document was uploaded? If "upload document" was clicked
          again, would this erase all of the documents or keep them (leading
          users to not act based on fear of wiping progress)? How do you add
          more documents or delete one document? These were all questions that
          arose during our critique.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some additional, more minor peer notes included adding the ability for
          users to be able to view what was uploaded so they can double check
          that they completed the upload correctly and adjusting the overall
          design to make room for informational headers. A peer also suggested
          adjusting some of the sizing proportions on our page, specifically
          pointing us towards the document upload button and suggesting that it
          be made smaller. There was also a suggestion to make the different
          sections on the home page more visually distinct, and a suggestion to
          include info buttons to provide more context on the documents.
        </p>
        <h3>Feedback From Point of Contact</h3>
        <p>
          In terms of Elise, our point of contact, she said that we did a great
          job of hiding complexity, but we had hid it a bit too well. She said
          that a user may be taken off guard by having to upload a document that
          they did not come prepared with, so she suggested maybe having a
          landing page where all of the documents needed in the process were
          listed so the user could feel prepared. Additionally, she also brought
          up the idea of handling the edge cases of the document upload process,
          including skipping during the process when a user may not have a given
          document at the moment. Lastly, she also suggested being more clear
          about the intention of the dropdown button (whether it's for required
          vs. uploaded documents).
        </p>

        <h2>Updating Our Wireframe</h2>
        <h3>Low-fi Wireframe: Iteration 2</h3>
        <img src="assets/figma/Lo-fi2.png" />
        <a
          class="bold"
          href="https://www.figma.com/file/dTd1HvNalOHYYo3x9HFsvd/Iterative-Lo-Fi%2C-Style-Guide%2C-and-Hi-Fi?type=design&node-id=248%3A1618&mode=design&t=ll9fR6IRVRSR588e-1"
          >Here is the link to our second Lo-Fi figma for a closer look.</a
        >
        <p>
          Our wireframe went through several changes after the critique session,
          but the largest change was arguably the creation of the landing page
          (see below) after clicking into "Go to application" (previously
          "upload documents", changed to diminish fear of clicking on the button
          also based on peer feedback). This landing page essentially was a
          duplicate of the dropdown on the home page in a larger form and
          included clear labels indicating whether a document has been uploaded.
          We also added a numerical status bar, an indicator of how many
          documents were left, and a written description of how to navigate
          around the page in order to further assist users with the document
          uploading process. We also included info buttons next to each button
          to provide more context about each document if needed. We felt like
          this page complimented the simplicity of our linear sequence of
          uploads but also provided the user with more context, which was
          something our point of contact suggested.
        </p>
        <div>
          <img class="prep" src="assets/figma/Prep-page.png" />
        </div>
        <p>
          In order to make the dropdown button on the home page more clear, we
          changed the label from "View documents" to "View uploaded documents"
          (see below) and made sure that the button only appears once the user
          has already uploaded at least one document, so that they would have
          more context on what the dropdown button is for.
        </p>
        <div>
          <img class="iframe-wrapper" src="assets/figma/Home-page.png" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Another change to the existing wireframe that we made based on peer
          feedback was to display uploaded documents on the individual document
          upload pages so that users could delete and add documents. Lastly, as
          told by at least three individuals during the peer review process, we
          changed the "I live on my own" button to fit in with the other
          options, and we also added info buttons to the documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          We did not take the feedback to add more information to our document
          headers, as we felt like that would add too much complexity to the
          cleanliness of the site. We also did not completely adopt the feedback
          to change the look of the home page upon finishing the upload, but we
          did add a small icon to signify the completion of a profile. We also
          felt like we could add more visual distinction between sections in the
          hi-fi prototype, once we decided on colors and headers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, we did not take the feedback on shrinking the size of our
          upload buttons, since our target audience should be Medicare members
          60 years and older.

          >Click the frame above to see the full style guide, or use this
          link</a
        >
        <p>
          We were originally given a style guide by our client, which gave us
          the shades of the background yellow and the dark green components. We
          believe that they chose these colors to match with the color of their
          logo, but besides that, the dark green was always used on a button, so
          the designer probably wanted to choose a color with great contrast to
          the rest of the scheme (light colors) to signify clickability. There
          were also a lot of colors (purples, pinks, yellows), but we felt they
          used those for more branding purposes, as they stuck primarily to
          green in their pages. Additionally, we think that the typography was
          chosen because its round font made the page less formal and
          intimidating (which is the intention of this webpage) while still
          making it easy to read.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our high-fidelity prototype, we mostly stuck to the color scheme
          and fonts given by the client, since the colors and fonts fit within
          the scheme of their webpage and were well-chosen for accessibility.
          However, there were several color schemes up for debate as well.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/figma/Warning.png" />
        <p>
          For example, our group had a small debate about the red color used to
          signify incompletion in our prototype. We were provided with a red
          color by the client's style guide, but when put in contrast with the
          yellow-white background, the red looked a bit more like an orange and
          did not have as much of a "warning" feeling. Therefore, we used a
          redder color for the incomplete documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our group also talked about the colors of the labels and arrows of the
          preparation page. We made them different colors (the label was a
          darker shade of red or green, and the info button and arrow button was
          black) to signify the difference in clickability. Since the free
          version of Figma does not allow hover effects, this was our way of
          signifying clickability.
        </p>
        <p>
          For icons, buttons, and other components, we stuck to the designs
          given to us in the example pages. However, we added a couple new
          colored icons and components (shown above) for purposes like warnings
          and successes, as we felt the color helped them stand out more.
        </p>

          >Click the frame above to interact with our Hi-Fi prototype, or use
          this link</a
        >
        <p>
          Structure-wise, our final Hi-Fi design was centered around the same
          principles as our Lo-Fi wireframe: spreading out the uploading process
          into multiple pages and creating multiple ways of interacting with the
          upload flow. We paid specific attention to making sure that users knew
          instinctively what to click on by highlighting specific buttons in
          dark green (moving on to the next document, starting the upload
          process, etc.) and changing the wording of some buttons as well ("go
          to application" instead of "upload documents"). We also separated
          sections with boxes to be consistent with the brand kit, but we used
          color to make interactive sections (like profiles and document list)
          stand out more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, we also made sure that users had a way of retracting on
          actions if they accidentally clicked something or were not prepared
          (for example, we give the option to remove documents with a simple
          click of the x button, the ability to skip certain documents, and also
          the ability to save and exit halfway through the process).
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Final Founder Feedback</h2>
        <h3>Positve Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          One feature that Elise liked about our prootype included the list of
          documents on the preparation page, which would be beneficial to users
          who might want a checklist they can use to gather documents. She also
          liked the instructions on the preparation page, which reassured the
          user by telling them that they didn't need to have every document
          ready. She also liked the two entry points on the homepage because
          they might help prevent mixup between members.
        </p>
        <h3>Constructive Feedback</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            One concern was the misuse of error state instead of empty state.
            Our prototype uses error states to communicate when a user hasn't
            uploaded something, but this is not due to an error, so there should
            be some default empty state. The error state should be reserved for
            documents that are not uploaded properly, or incorrect documents
            (which is something that is manually checked by the Uno team).
          </li>
          <li>
            Another concern was the upload pages. There's enough space to
            display some context about the document but our prototype stores
            everything in an info button. Also, we use the labels "Primary
            Member" and "Spouse," which can be more explicit if replaced with
            the names of users.
          </li>
          <li>
            In addition, Elise discussed the tradeoff between simplicity and
            flexibility.The linear sequence simplifies the upload process, so
            that should be the most obvious route to take. The other routes
            (allowing the user to navigate to a specific page) should be
            downplayed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lastly, we talked about the purpose of the dropdown route. Since
            users might not expect to see a list of documents, and be able to
            navigate from the dropdown, this feature might not be discovered /
            used. It's also a puplicate route (similar to the preparation page),
            so it could be simplified to just how many documents need to be
            uploaded. It's ok if the user needs to click one extra button to see
            the same information.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <hr />
        <h2>Learnings and Reflections</h2>
        <p>
          A key way in which we improved our soft skills relating to design was
          in our experience working as a team throughout the design process.
          This gave us a chance to deal with disagreements that come up and to
          work through design problems more explicitly, since we all had to be
          on the same page about everything. Over the course of this project, we
          developed a true understanding of the idea that "the first design is
          never the best one."" Iteration based not only on our own cognitive
          walkthroughs but also on direct feedback from others is critical, and
          the integration of that feedback is perhaps even more important than
          developing the initial design starting point.
          <br /><br />
          On the more technical side of things, we significantly improved our
          skills in Figma, including developing working prototypes that one can
          click through. We also got experience using Loom and had practice in
          making short videos that were able to concisely and clearly display
          our work. All in all, we had a great experience working on this
          project together, and look forward to continuing to develop our skills
          in future endeavors.
