          <h2>Introduction and Context</h2>
          <p>
            In this project, I had the opportunity to redesign a websiteto
            include better design principles, including responding to different
            screen sizes. This project showcases my front end web development
            skills as well as my knowledge of and ability to apply core design
            principles.

            Why I chose it: Choosing a website was actually somewhat of a
            challenge for me, but I followed the advice on the handout and
            looked at local government websites, eventualy finding one neaby
            Providence; I chose it since the design immediately to me looked to
            be in need of improvement, and there was no responsiveness to mobile
            use, which I was actually on at the time of finding the website.
          </p> -->
          </div>
          <div id="problems">
            <h3>Issues with the Site</h3>
            <p>
              There were some primary issues with this site that I sought to fix
              in my redesign:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In the table for the agendas and minutes the agenda and minutes
                documents for a partpicular meeting are not necessarily
                horizontally aligned, which can create confusion and unnecessary
                extra scanning
              </li>
              <li>
                While there is clear delineation for seperate years, there is
                none for months, making it somewhat challenging to locate a
                specific month's agenda/minutes
              </li>
              <li>
                There is no responsive redesign for a mobile app, meaning users
                are relegated to the same interface whose proportions are not
                ideal on a small screen size. This impedes all user types, since
                the interface is simply not designed to handle a mobile sized
                screen
              </li>
              <li>
                The town administrative information is scattered between the top
                and bottom, and it is densely packed without a lot of meta-info
                that explains the relevance
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              All of these problems can lead to issues with learnability,
              memorability, and efficiency:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Learnability:</b> the interface is relatively simple,
                although the problems I brought up could make using the
                interface to locate certain agendas/minutes more challenging
                than necessary
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Memorability:</b> returning users may have trouble memorizing
                the specific place of a certain link to an agenda/minutes
                document and then may have to search the entire table again
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Efficiency:</b> frequent users could have the same troubles
                as only semi-frequent returning users, where it is very hard to
                memorize the specific location of one of the document links;
                additionally, for every new meeting (a semi-monthly event), the
                table is shifted downward, further complicating the issue of
                being able to remember a specific location
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div id="accessibility">
            <h3>Accessibility Considerations</h3>
            <p>
              I also looked at the accessibility of the site. I generated this
              WebAIM report (<a
                href="https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://www.glocesterri.gov/towncouncil.htm"
                >linked here</a
              >):
            </p>
            <!-- <p>Here is a partial screenshot of part of the report:</p>
          <img
            id="original-site"
            alt="Screenshot of the WebAIM WAVE reoprt for the original version of the website I redesigned."
            src="./assets/webaim_wave.png"
          /> -->
            <!-- <p> 
            Link to the report:
            <a
              href="https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://www.glocesterri.gov/towncouncil.htm"
              >Here</a
            >
          </p> -->
            <div class="iframe-wrapper">
              <iframe
                style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"
                width="800"
                height="450"
                src="https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://www.glocesterri.gov/towncouncil.htm"
                allowfullscreen
              ></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>
              The report emphasizes issues relating to color contrast,
              especially as it relates to the links within the table to the
              agendas/minutes. Additionally, the color of the email links, being
              the same, also does not have sufficient contrast. Just looking at
              the page, the color does not seem ideal since it is bright red and
              hard to read, making it not ideal for text.
            </p>
            <p>
              The report also references some other more behind the scenes
              issues with the page. No tiered headings (h1, h2, etc.) are used
              in the site, which is problematic since those using a screen
              reader need those headings to help provide structure to the page
              so they can understand it. Additionally, the report noted that the
              logo image lacked alt text, another accesssibility issue for
              individuals who make use of a screen reader.

          In this segment of the project, I developed my redesign, starting with

          <h2>Solution Part 2: Coded Responsive Redesign</h2>
          <!-- <p>
          In this final component of the project, I created my redesigned
          website using HTML and CSS, utilizing flex boxes and media queries to
          allow for responsiveness.
        </p> -->
          <p>
            Finally, I coded my website using HTML and CSS. I used a flexbox
            display in order to prioritize responsiveness. I also included media
            queries based on the screen size that changed the flexbox CSS.
            Specifically, on a mobile device, all elements are vertical, while
            as the screen size gets larger and larger more elements are instead
            located horozintally from one another. You can take a look at my
            redesigned site below (notice that it responds to fit the in site
            frame, in contrast to the initial site above) or view the site

          <h2>Learnings and Reflections</h2>
          <p>
            Over the course of completing this project, I have had the chance to
            both improve my skills as a designer as well as develop improved
            thinking patterns relating to design. Regarding the former, I got
            great experience using Figma to create a visual style guide and
            mockups; I also got the chance to use vanilla HTML and CSS
            (including media queries and flexbox) to create a full-fledged
            website, modulo the interactive components. Considering my improved
            designer mindset, I had the chance to think about core design
            principles such as layout, color, visual hierachy, etc. and apply
            them to a real world scenario. Overall, I am pleased with what I
            have accomplished and I look forward to developing my skills in
            future endevours.
