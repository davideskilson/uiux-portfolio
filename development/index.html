        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, my fourth assignment in CSCI 1300: User Interfaces
          and User Experiences, I had the chance to go through the actual
          development process of building a web app. I built a website from
          scratch using React that involves filtering, sorting, and aggregating
          functionality, and I ultimately deployed that site using Vercel.

        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          In this initial phase of the project, I had the chance to conduct my
          own competitive analysis of websites with a favoriting function and
          consider the various features related to sorting and filtering within
          the favoring aggregation feature. I then reflected on the analysis and
          ultimately used it for inspiration for what features I would like to
          include on the site I eventually built.
        </p>
        <div>
          <p>
            Here is a competitive comparison chart for my three chosen websites:
          </p>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th></th>
              <th>
                <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#starred">Gmail</a>
              </th>
              <th>
                <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
              </th>
              <th>
                <a href="https://photos.google.com/search/_m8_Favorites"
                  >Google Photos</a
                >
              </th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>
                Allows filtering aggregated favorites by some sort of date (e.g.
                creation or last modified)
              </td>
              <td>&#9989; (filtering from when the starred email was sent)</td>
              <td>&#10060;</td>
              <td>&#10060;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>
                Allows sorting aggregated favorites by some an additional type
                of date (e.g. last modified or last viewed)
              </td>
              <td>&#10060;</td>
              <td>&#9989; (sorting by recently starred and recently added)</td>
              <td>&#10060;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>
                Allows filtering aggregated favorites by one or more properties
                of the items
              </td>
              <td>&#9989; (numerous, including sender/receiver)</td>
              <td>&#9989; (by programming language and public/private)</td>
              <td>&#10060;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

              <td>&#9135; (only one, by total number of stars)</td>
              <td>&#10060;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

              <td>&#9989; (one click)</td>

          </table>

            Overall, I found that it was most effective when the websites had
            more options for filtering and sorting and when those features
            worked well in combination. In the next few paragraphs, seperated by
            website for readability, I analyze each of the websites in the
            context of design principles from class and my competitive analysis
            chart.

            Referencing Gmail, the text search feature was especially useful
            considering the vast amount of favorite emails that one can
            accumulate over time. Additionally, the interface dropdowns for
            filtering options were quite useful in considering the options and
            using different filters. Also, it was quite useful that the default
            arrangement of favorites in chronology mirrored the default
            arrangement and look of general emails in the main inbox, allowing
            the transfer of a mental model. Thus, Gmail had a very successful
            aggregation interface with its extensive filtering catagories that
            were easy to select and very thorough.
          </p>
          <p>
            For GitHub, the filtering was also very well done, with clear
            catagories in a dropdown. I will note, however, that the arrangement
            of repositories did not include information about public vs. private
            by default in the aggregator, requiring extra clicks for a user to
            have to navigate to see that information. All in all, however,
            GitHub had a successful aggregating interface due to the easy to use
            dropdowns as well as the ability to also sort the aggregated
            repositories using different options.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google Photos had the weakest favoriting feature since it lacked any
            filtering or sorting through the photos, and there was no way to
            search photos for objects or location or anything like that.
            Additionally, from the perspective of class design principles, it
            was not immediately clear how to unfavorite an image from the
            general aggregated favorite menu; I had to experiment a bit and
            explore by clicking around in the image, meaning that the feature
            had poor learnability. With all of that in mind, Google Photos had
            an unsuccessful favoriting interface that essentially just displayed
            the favorites without giving the user the ability to sort or filter
            their favorites to look for a specific image.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on my competitive analysis chart and summary paragraphs, here
            is a list of features that I would like to implement in my own web
            app:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Multiple filtering catagories that can work simultaneously,
              created using dropdowns - this can be implemented using React to
              check the properties of items
            </li>
            <li>
              One (or more if time) option(s) for sorting created using
              dropdowns - this can be implemented using React to sort the items
              by a property as their component is being created
            </li>
            <li>
              Filtering and sorting that work at the same time - this can be
              implemented by ensuring no conflicts occur in my React
              implementation of the respective parts of the assignment
            </li>
            <li>
              One click removal of items from my aggregator - this can be
              accomplished by including a place to click in the aggregator by
              each element that allows for its removal (note: will instead have
              the removal button be with the item card if time constrains come
              up)
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Set Up</h2>
        <p>
          In this section of the project, I set up a GitHub repo that included a
          README and used the create-react-app command to allow me to build my
          app from scrath.

        <h2>Functionality</h2>
        <p>
          In this part of the project, I chose a theme for my app and coded it
          using React. This app includes aggregation, filtering, and sorting,
          and it also follows design principles from class and is accessible
          (checked with WebAIM).
        </p>
        <p>
          My theme is a book based app, which will allow users to choose their
          favorites from a list of books. Additionally, users can also utilize
          the list of books to look for books that are of potential interest to
          them. In order to ease their searching process for books in the list,
          the web app will allow filtering by author name and book genre, and it
          will allow sorting by book length in terms of word count. Users will
          therefore be able to aggregate their favorite books, and then filter
          the books in the overall book list perhaps using a feature about a
          book that they chose to favorite, and then can sort the books by word
          count if they desire books of a certain length.

          In this portion of the project, I deployed the app that I built using
          Vercel.

          In this final division of the project, I wrote up a README in the root
          directory of my react app repository. This README included a link to
          my deployed app, instructions for how to locally run my web app, and a
          list of known bugs (of which there are currently none).

        <h2>Conclusion and Reflections</h2>
        <p>
          Over the course of this project, I was able to both get experience in
          design by critically analyzing features of another web app as well as
          go through the full development process including coding and
          deploying. This coding experiene included the implemetnation of a
          favoriting feature as well as sorting and filtering, all critical
          frameworks for many websites. I feel as though I have had the chance
          to learn a lot about design and development from completing this
          project, and I look forward to continuing to advance my design and
          front end engineering skills in future endevours.
