        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This is my second project for CSCI 1300: User Interfaces and User
          Experiences. In this assignment, I had the opportunity to redesign a
          website of my choice to include better design principles, including
          responding to different screen sizes. Throughout the process, I had
          the chance to brainstorm, sketch, create low-fidelity and
          high-fidelity wireframes, and ultimately use vanilla HTML and CSS to
          create the redesigned website.

        <h2>Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
        <p>
          In this section, I picked my website and analyzed its problems,
          including those relating to general use as well as accessibility.
        </p>
        <div id="picking-webpage">
          <h3>Picking a Webpage</h3>
          <p>
            Link to the website:
            <a href="https://www.glocesterri.gov/towncouncil.htm">Here</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Screenshot (note that the website continues below the screenshot;
            navigate to the link to see the page in its entirety):
          </p>
          <img
            id="original-site"
            alt="Screenshot of the original website that I redesigned for this project."
            src="./assets/website_screenshot.png"
          />
          <p>
            Why I chose it: Choosing a website was actually somewhat of a
            challenge for me, but I followed the advice on the handout and
            looked at local government websites, eventualy finding one neaby
            Providence; I chose it since the design immediately to me looked to
            be in need of improvement, and there was no responsiveness to mobile
            use, which I was actually on at the time of finding the website.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="problems">
          <h3>Finding Problems</h3>
          <p>There were some primary issues with this site:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the table for the agendas and minutes the agenda and minutes
              documents for a partpicular meeting are not necessarily
              horizontally aligned, which can create confusion and unnecessary
              extra scanning
            </li>
            <li>
              While there is clear delineation for seperate years, there is none
              for months, making it somewhat challenging to locate a specific
              month's agenda/minutes
            </li>
            <li>
              There is no responsive redesign for a mobile app, meaning users
              are relegated to the same interface whose proportions are not
              ideal on a small screen size. This impedes all user types, since
              the interface is simply not designed to handle a mobile sized
              screen
            </li>
            <li>
              The town administrative information is scattered between the top
              and bottom, and it is densely packed without a lot of meta-info
              that explains the relevance
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All of these problems can lead to issues with learnability,
            memorability, and efficiency:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Learnability:</b> the interface is relatively simple, although
              the problems I brought up could make using the interface to locate
              certain agendas/minutes more challenging than necessary
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Memorability:</b> returning users may have trouble memorizing
              the specific place of a certain link to an agenda/minutes document
              and then may have to search the entire table again
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Efficiency:</b> frequent users could have the same troubles as
              only semi-frequent returning users, where it is very hard to
              memorize the specific location of one of the document links;
              additionally, for every new meeting (a semi-monthly event), the
              table is shifted downward, further complicating the issue of being
              able to remember a specific location
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="accessibility">
          <h3>Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            In order to consider accessibility, I generated a WebAIM WAVE
            report.
          </p>
          <p>Here is a partial screenshot of part of the report:</p>
          <img
            id="original-site"
            alt="Screenshot of the WebAIM WAVE reoprt for the original version of the website I redesigned."
            src="./assets/webaim_wave.png"
          />
          <p>
            Link to the report:
            <a
              href="https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://www.glocesterri.gov/towncouncil.htm"
              >Here</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The report emphasizes issues relating to color contrast, especially
            as it relates to the links within the table to the agendas/minutes.
            Additionally, the color of the email links, being the same, also
            does not have sufficient contrast. Just looking at the page, the
            contrast does seem insufficient, since the color itself used for the
            links is bright and hard to read, making it not ideal for text.
          </p>
          <p>
            The report also references some other more behind the scenes issues
            with the page. No tiered headings (h1, h2, etc.) are used in the
            site, which is problematic since those using a screen reader need
            those headings to help provide structure to the page so they can
            understand it. Additionally, the report noted that the logo image
            lacked alt text, another accesssibility issue for individuals who
            make use of a screen reader.

        <h2>Visual Redesign</h2>
        <p>
          In this segment of the project, I developed my redesign, starting with
          simple speed sketches to brainstorm and ultimately ending up with
          high-fidelity mockups made in Figma that closely mirror the final
          page.

            I did some speed sketching to brainstorm ideas for my redesign. Here
            are my nine sketches, completed one per minute:

            the cards from sketches 3, 5, and 7; the information button from
            card 9; and the link navigation mechanism from sketch 4.

          <p>
            Here are my three low-fidelity mockups, each for a different screen
            size. I added annotations to them that indicate how they solve the
            problems I discussed earlier. Note that for reference, I include a
            side-by-side blank frame of the corrosponding device's size.

            Please note that I did not make these images larger so as to ease
            navigation on this overall site, but the images are sufficiently
            high quality that zooming in on the details is be possible if
            desired.

          In this final component of the project, I created my redesigned

          allow for responsiveness.

        <h2>Conclusion and Reflections</h2>
        <p>
          Over the course of the assignment, I have had the chance to both
          improve my skills as a designer as well as develop improved thinking
          patterns relating to design. Regarding the former, I got my first true
          experiene using Figma to create a visual style guide and mockups; I
          also got the chance to use vanilla HTML and CSS (including media
          queries) to create a full-fledged website, modulo the interactive
          components. Considering my improved designer mindset, I had the chance
          to think about the design principles we have discussed in class such
          as font choices, layout, color, visual hierachy, etc. and apply them
          to a real world scenario. Overall, I am pleased with what I have
          accomplished and I look forward to developing these skills in future
          assignments.
